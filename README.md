# Docker-Installation-in-RHEL8
This repository gives a python script to install and configure docker in RHEL8 machine

Generally if a developer or any user wants to install Docker on their machine , they have to run multiple lines of code in their machine and this might not be piece of cake for them. So, Here comes the solution, I've created a python program which will automatically configure docker in your machine along with containers if you want. You can also configure basic http server using this program. 

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:
Just Download the latest version of Docker in your machine and run main.py (make sure to download the complete folder)
That's it , now within few inputs , your docker is installed.
